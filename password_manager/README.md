# Password Manager (CLI)

## Instructions:

```
Build a command-line password manager that securely stores and retrieves users’ passwords for various accounts.

Users can add new credentials (service name, username, password), retrieve them based on the service name, and protect their password database using a master password.


Use encryption to store the passwords to ensure privacy and security.
```

## Key Features:

- Add new credentials by providing a **service name**, **username**, **password**.
- **Retrieve** credentials by using the **service name**( retrieving credentials for your 'LinkedIn' where 'LinkendIn' is your service name).
- Since passwords are suppoded to be stored securely, you can use the **cryptography** library in Python to encrypt and decrypt passwords.
- **Save** and **load** credentials from an encrypted file.
- Use a **master password** to **unlock** the password manager.

NB: **Advisable to save data to a local file e.g JSON.**
