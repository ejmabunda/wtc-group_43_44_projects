# Password Manager (CLI)

## Instructions:

```
Build a command-line password manager that securely stores and retrieves usersâ€™ passwords for various accounts.

Users can add new credentials (service name, username, password), retrieve them based on the service name, and protect their password database using a master password.


Use encryption to store the passwords to ensure privacy and security.
```

## Key Features:

- Add new credentials by providing a **service name**, **username**, **password**.
- **Retrieve** credentials by using the **service name**( retrieving credentials for your 'LinkedIn' where 'LinkendIn' is your service name).
- Since passwords are suppoded to be stored securely, you can use the **cryptography** library in Python to encrypt and decrypt passwords.
- **Save** and **load** credentials from an encrypted file.
- Use a **master password** to **unlock** the password manager.

NB: **Advisable to save data to a local file e.g JSON.**
