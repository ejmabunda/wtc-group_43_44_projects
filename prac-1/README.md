# Petrol Station App Challenge

Welcome to the Petrol Station App Challenge! In this assignment, you will build a Python application that simulates a petrol station. The application will have the following features:

1. User authentication.
2. Displaying a menu of items and options.
3. Calculating how many liters of petrol the user can get for a given price.
4. User-friendly interaction and error handling.
5. I am expecting you to create your own functions too, although that is up to you

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. Open `group_exercise.py` and complete the TODOs within the functions as instructed. Provide comments for your code to explain its purpose.

3. Open `group_tests.py` and run the provided tests. Ensure that your code passes all the tests.

4. The application should interact with the user in a friendly manner. You can include jokes or personal touches to make the user experience enjoyable.

5. Run the application by executing `group_exercise.py`. Ensure that it provides the expected functionality and user experience.

6. After completing the code, write more extensive documentation for the functions and main application in `group_exercise.py`.

7. Commit your changes and push them to your repository.

8. I will be checking on your progress at the end of the day :)

Good luck, and have fun building the Petrol Station App!
